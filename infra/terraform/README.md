# AuthClaw Terraform

This directory is the SRS NFR-3.1 baseline for deploying AuthClaw as a multi-region AWS stack.

It creates a primary regional stack and, by default, a warm secondary regional stack. Each region includes:

- VPC with public/private subnets across availability zones
- Public ALB listeners for console, backend API, and gateway
- ECS/Fargate services for console, backend, gateway, OPA, and Presidio
- Private Cloud Map service discovery for internal service URLs
- Encrypted RDS PostgreSQL and encrypted ElastiCache Redis
- Optional RDS cross-region read replica for the secondary database
- KMS key, Secrets Manager entries, and CloudWatch log groups
- Optional audit consumer wired to managed Kafka/MSK and ClickHouse endpoints
- Optional Route53 primary/secondary failover alias record

## Usage

Copy the example variables, set image tags and cloud-specific values, then plan:

```bash
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

The example defaults use `authclaw_env = "staging"` so the stack can be validated before production-only dependencies are configured. For a production deployment, set:

- `authclaw_env = "production"`
- `domain_name`
- `primary_certificate_arn`
- `secondary_certificate_arn`
- `smtp_host`
- `smtp_from`
- production image digests instead of floating `latest` tags

The OPA image must include the AuthClaw Rego policy bundle from `infra/opa`, or use an equivalent OPA bundle configuration baked into the image.

## Multi-Region Model

The root module deploys regional stacks with separate KMS keys, Redis clusters, ECS services, and secrets. Route53 failover can point the same public name at the primary or secondary ALB.

By default, `enable_cross_region_db_replica = true` creates the secondary PostgreSQL database as an encrypted RDS cross-region read replica of the primary database. The secondary region receives its own database connection secrets that point at the replica endpoint and use the primary database password. After promotion, the replica endpoint becomes writable without rotating application secrets.

This gives AuthClaw a concrete warm-standby RPO/RTO story:

- RPO is bounded by RDS asynchronous replication lag.
- RTO is the time to promote the replica, confirm write readiness, and route traffic to the secondary ALB.
- The secondary database is read-only until promotion, so automated Route53 failover must be paired with promotion automation or replaced with a manual failover decision.

Set `enable_cross_region_db_replica = false` only when you intentionally want isolated regional test databases. See `DR_RUNBOOK.md` for the promotion flow.

## Audit Integrations

Kafka and ClickHouse are treated as managed external services:

- Set `kafka_brokers` for gateway/backend audit publication.
- Set `clickhouse_host`, `clickhouse_*`, and `enable_audit_consumer = true` to run the audit consumer.
- Create MSK topics from `../kafka/topics.yaml`: `gateway.traffic`, `audit.events`, and `audit.deadletter`.
- Use tenant-keyed partitioning (`tenant_id`) so each tenant's audit chain is consumed in order.

This keeps the regional AuthClaw stack portable while still making the audit path explicit in IaC.

## Operations Notes

- The backend image should run migrations before serving traffic, either in its entrypoint or via a one-off ECS task using the same `backend_database_url` secret.
- Configure ACM certificates in every region where HTTPS listeners are used.
- Test RDS replica promotion regularly; Terraform creates the standby path, but operations prove the RTO.
- Avoid committing real `*.tfvars` files; only `*.tfvars.example` is tracked.
